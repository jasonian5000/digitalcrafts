    <p>This exercise is about making lists</p>
    <p>Here's what I like about lists:</p>
    <ul> 
        <li>They're useful</li>
        <li>That's about it</li>
        <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
    </ul>    
    <p>When you make a list do it in this order:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
        <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tage, otherwise use the ol tag
            <ul><li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items
                <ol><li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
                    </ol>
            </li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
    </ol>
