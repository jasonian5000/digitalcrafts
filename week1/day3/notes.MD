# Lists and Arrays

- array == list
- Access things inside of list using an index
- array[0] <--- index

## Time and Space Complexity
- reading an index = O(1)
- inserting = O(n)
- reading all = O(n)
- n = the size of the list
- creating a list takes O(n) space complexity
- reading a list at an index taht we know array[i], takes constant time O(1)
- updating a list at an index takes constant time O(1)
- deleting a list at an index takes constant time O(n)
